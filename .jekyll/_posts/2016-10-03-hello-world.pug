text: So I decided to make my first post on my website. This shot is from the the Kristansten Fortress in Trondheim. The fortress gave place to the last execution in Norway, but I visit this place often for another reason. The view is amazing! You can get a nice shot almost any time of the year. Visit!
location: Trondheim, Sør-Trøndelag, Norway
