## What is NextAuth.js?

_I would like to grab the opportunity to say a few words to those are new to Next.js and/or authentication. If you are familiar and just want to read about the new stuff, feel free to [skip](#how-i-ended-up-maintaining-nextauthjs) this section._

A short summary if you are not familiar with NextAuth.js: It is a an authentication library, originally created by Iain Collins for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). It is allows you to easily add authentication to your Next.js applications, integrating with the most popular OAuth authentication providers, such as [Google, Facebook, GitHub, Twitter etc.](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/providers/oauth#built-in-providers). (Think of the "Sign in with X" buttons on pages you have visited before.) It also supports the [passwordless authentication](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/providers/email) method, which allows you to authenticate users without having to enter a password, sending a one-time-use token to user's email address. For a more traditional method, there is also the possibility to add a [Credentials provider](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/providers/credentials), where the user is asked for their username and password.

Let's talk about the first method, using OAuth providers. People have been using OAuth providers for a long time, probably without even knowing what that actually mean for them. Authentication is hard <Emoji label="hot face">ü•µ</Emoji>. Without a proper security team, it is probably best to delegate this task to a third party who has proven to deliver safety at scale. NextAuth.js is the bridge between you, the app developer, and these third party services. All you need is to configure the third-party service to give us access to their API, and we will take care of the rest. **EXPLAIN HERE**

Using such a provider basically let's you "borrow" those big companies' infrastructure and security expertise for your own page to authenticate users. Doesn't that sound great? <Emoji label="star struck">ü§©</Emoji>?

But let's say you want your own database, with storing your own users. Guess what? You can still user these providers and the first time your user logs in, NextAuth.js can save the desired data to your own database. It will also safely and automatically link accounts (users of different providers) to the same user in the database, if they have the same email address. This allows you to create a robust system with offering users many different ways to authenticate.

Passwordless authentication is failry new, but it has also gainded popularity because of its simplicity. People are generally horrible at remembering their passwords. Asking them to create a new one on every new app is a pain, but they might already have remembered their usual apps' passwords (like Google or Facebook). or they are using a Password Manager for those. With this method, the user only enters an e-mail address, and they receive an e-mail with a link, which if they click, it logs them into your app. Magic <Emoji label="rainbow">üåà</Emoji>! Again, you rely on a third party to deliver the authentication part (here we assume that the user is already logged into their e-mail account, where they used their e-mail provider's auth system).

Finally the Credentials provider. If you are building a traditional app with a traditional login solution, we've got you, do note we only give the most basic tools, as implemening such an auth system required the most experience (if you haven't heard about cryptography, hashing, salting etc., it might be a good sign to check out the alternatives).

## How I ended up maintaining NextAuth.js

Since this is _my_ blog, I wanted to share my journey with NextAuth.js. It is important to note, that it is Iain who has created an amazing base for the project. But for **about a year now**, I have taken over the project.

At work, we just started off with our first Next.js project, and in the frontend, we needed an auth solution. When I stumbled upon Iain's project, we had to look no further. Even though there were some small _quirks_, it solved our issues amazingly well. And the curious person I am, I wanted to know if I could help ironing out those _quirks_. Gaining the trust of Iain, I was made a co-maintainer in 2020 December. To understand the goals and motivation behind the project, I had to understand what its users were using it for, and what they were struggling with. In the first few weeks, I went through literally hundreds of issues, identifying the pain points. Most of them were simple, like missing documentation, or outdated TypeScript types (at DefinitelyTyped at the time, maintained by Lluis and other amazing community members). I love JavaScript and open-source, and looking through other popular/successful projects, I noticed one thing. Their source code is written by many people. Many people, who don't necessarily see the whole picture, but rely on each other and supportive tools that give confidence for refactoring and rapid iteration.

## NextAuth.js v3 and a half(?)

Since I've started maintaining the project, I've also introdced changes to v3, which I never really talked about. But since some of it were essential for v4, I'll mention them briefly as well.

### TypeScript

One of the most adopted tool of a JavaScript developer is TypeScript. Not only providing hints about available APIs and inline documentation, TypeScript makes refactoring super easy for even newcomers to the project. When I became a co-maintainer, I knew and understood exactly zero of the source code. To help myself along the way, when I needed to write anything new, I always added JSDoc comments to myself, which you can think as a loose, compile-less version of TypeScript. With loose, I mean it gives a false sense of safety and confidence, but good enough so that you don't have to jump between modules to track the certain things.

As my understanding for the source code grew, and I had more and more of these JSDoc comments in place, I decided to involve the DefinitelyTyped maintainer, Lluis, and ask him if he was interested in migrating the community types into the core. I could not only get an awesome person on my small "team", but we could deliver up-to-date types for the community, that will result in less issues and faster development. We then gradually migrated the types into the core, and now the `@types/next-auth` is deprecated!

There might still be some small quirks, so if you find any, please let us know. But for the majority of users, the migration should have resulted in a lot less issues. more confidence, and inline documentation in modern IDEs like VScode.

### Adapters

As mentioned earlier, you can use NextAuth.js to save user data in your database of choice. To communicate with databases, NextAuth.js uses [Database Adapters](https://next-auth.js.org/adapters/overview). When NextAuth.js v3 came out with a single one, using TypeORM under the hood. A fairly popular ORM at the time. The community soon saw the possibility, and wanted to expand beyond TypeORM. A Prisma adapter soon appeared in the source code, copying on the existing adapter.

This was awesome, because from now on, users could be able to write their own adapters, and just like with the OAuth providers, we could give full freedom to the user about their database.

The problem was that writing the adapters as part of the core repository wasn't truly scaleable. In contrast to the OAuth providers which are very simple configuration objects, an adapter can use extra dependencies, and the code is generally a bit more complex. So, I decided to create a separate [repository for adapters](https://github.com/nextauthjs/adapters). Enter Nico. Another amazing person to our small team! I haven't worked with databases before, and I needed all the help to get started. I did not just want to migrate the existing adapters, but I wanted to make sure that the community can easily add new ones!

We created a basic set of tests, that can test any adapters, and if those tests pass, you can be sure that it will work with NextAuth.js. Soon enough, the community saw the opportunity and started opening pull requests! Check out the repo if you want to see your own adapter!

To make it easier to write adapters, I wanted them to be as simple as possible, and moved a lot of the complex logic (like token hashing, error handling etc.) to the core. This way, a database adapter is exactly what the name suggests, a broker for your database, sending and receiving data.

## NextAuth.js v4

Phew! Now that we are all caught up, let's finally see the goodies! What's exactly new in v4?

> If you are coming from v3, we have created an [upgrade guide](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/upgrade-v4) for you.

### Improved OAuth and OIDC support

NextAuth.js has already had a stellar list of built-in providers, but we wanted to make it even easier to add new ones! One of the tasks were to remove any provider-specific "glue" code from the core, and rely more heavily on the OAuth specification. `oidc-client`, `jose` and its maintainer deserve a huge applause for this, because without [@panva](https://github.com/panva) and his truly amazing projects, v4 probably wouldn't have been possible. <Emoji label="clap">üëè</Emoji>. Filip delivers true quality and shows his passion well.

Moving to `oidc-client` required a refactor, but it was a huge success. It is simpler than ever to [add your own custom provider](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/providers/oauth#using-a-custom-provider) to NextAuth.js, if you cannot find it in the built-in providers.

### Normalized APIs, focus on future extendability

Without going deeper into API changes in an already long post, one of my main focus for v4 was to make it easier for future versions to implement new things, without breaking old behavior. Callback methods that previously used 5+ parameters are now using named parameters, so you can grab exactly what you need, leaving the rest of the params out, the adapters forward any data they are given so you don't need a whole custom adapter to save something that isn't the default, and so on. Check out the [migration guide](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/upgrade-v4) for a more comprehensive overview.

From v4 onward, I also hope to adapt a more rapid release process, maybe using something like Next.js's `experimental` flags. v4 has taken way too long to be released! Open for suggestions.

### Testing of Providers

TODO

### Decoupled core from Next.js

This one is probably new for most of you, and it's probably one of the changes that I am most excited about, because it will let us expand to other frameworks, engage with new communities, and hopefully get some new maintainers on the project. The more the merrier <Emoji label="blush">üòä</Emoji>!

The core functionality of `next-auth` is now independent of Next.js API routes. Interestingly, this change was also the key to improve the performance of the library in certain situations.

#### `getServerSession`

The Next.js documentation explains that you should not use fetch calls to communicate with your own API routes, just import the logic directly. To keep the library simple, this rule has been broken by `next-auth`, which sacrificed performance. It is better explained in [this issue](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/1535). In short, a new API is coming, that will improve the performance on serverless platforms like Vercel.

```ts:pages/ssr-protexted.tsx
// import { getSession } from 'next-auth/react' // current way
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth/next'
import { options } from "pages/api/auth/[...nextauth]"
...

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  // const session = await getSession(context.req) // current way
  const session = await getServerSession(context, options)
  return  {
    props: {
      session
    }
  }
}
```

This API is still undocumented and should be considered experimental, but similarily to get the session, it will make server-side sign-in and sign-out easier, in addition to opening up for a whole new set of frameworks!
