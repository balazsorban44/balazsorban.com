### Hello world

This site has existed for a while, but probably haven't received many visitors until now, so I just wanted to introduce myself pretty quickly. My name is BalÃ¡zs OrbÃ¡n and I am a Software Engineer at the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) team.

How did I get here? I was born in Hungary <Emoji label="Hungarian flag">ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡º</Emoji>. I have a twin brother, who - just like me - ended up as an exchange student in a different country while we were still in high school. I chose to see Norway <Emoji label="Norwegian flag">ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´</Emoji>.

The visit was supposed to be only 10 months, but boy, did I end up living here <Emoji label="Grinning face, with smiling eyes">ðŸ˜„</Emoji>. After spending almost a year in the Lofoten Islands with a Norwegian family, I went back to Hungary to finish high school, but right after that I decided I wanted to study Computer Science, I was going to do it in Norway.

I got into the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://ntnu.edu) in Trondheim, where I currently live and work from. My past work experience includes a broad varity of jobs, but it I was always interested in copmuters and software development the most. I landed my first full-time job while still studying at one of the biggest health-related content providers in Norway [Norwgian Health Informatics](https://www.nhi.no).

### Hello Vercel

When I was contacted by [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to have a chat about some of their roles, my heart probably dropped a beat. I have been following them for a while, because I was so impressed by their innovations in the industry and the sheer speed they were delivering all that! I was very excited to be able to work with a team that was so passionate about what they do. My maintainer work at [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org) seemed to pay off big time. (Follow-up post on NextAuth.js with some exciting announcements is coming soon...!) I ended up getting an offer from these amazing people, and now I can call myself a â–² Vercelian <Emoji label="Partying face">ðŸ¥³</Emoji>.
