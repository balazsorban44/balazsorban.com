# balazsorban44.github.io

This repository is to maintain my website available at **[balazsorban.com](http://balazsorban.com)**.

I use preprocessor languages like:

* PUG
* SASS
* CoffeScript

And jQuery too.


This is my most advanced project so far, built totally from scratch, using all I have learnt so far. Though I try to maintain the site regularly, I can only do it in my freetime, since I am a university student at the moment.
